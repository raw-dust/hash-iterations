# hash-iterations
This Generate a hash by rehashing an input a number of times you chose and places the result in your clipboard. This can used to create a password that you do not want to store on a keychain. Choosing a strong input and a high number of iterations that causes the calculation to take many seconds can make a somewhat secure password. However, use multi factor authentication on all your sites.

## Directions
* Enter text to be hashed.
* Enter the number of times to hash the text. Ideally, greater han 10,000,000
* The hash is calculated, displayed on the screen, and saved to your clipboard.
